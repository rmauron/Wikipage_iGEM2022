        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Panel discussion</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
In the very beginning of our iGEM journey, we arranged brainstorming sessions to discuss both global and local problems that are affecting society. During our brainstorming phase, we also organized a panel discussion with researchers from different fields to discuss our four project ideas. Different team members got to present the projects in front of the experts and after every presentation, the experts got time to ask questions and give us feedback.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
It was important for us to have different experts in the panel so we can get help with different parts of our project. Therefore we contacted both researchers from academia and industry but also experts within product development. The panel included experts from KTH, SciLifeLab, AstraZeneca, KI Innovation and Merck Innovation hub.

      <section id="tag6">
        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Dr. Haitham Aldaher</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
During our iGEM year, we got the opportunity to talk with many researchers and doctors about our project and solution. One of the doctors we got the opportunity to interview was Dr. Haitham Aldaher, working in a child-care center in Stockholm. He is a specialist in pediatric neurology and has been working with children for decades. Even though we are focusing on pernicious anemia, a disease that is not so common among children and young people which also was confirmed by him, we still wanted to hear more about his experience.</p> 

        <p class="reveal">
When we asked about his opinion regarding our solution, he was very positive to it. Our idea with developing a pill would replace intramuscular injections, which would make life a bit easier for the patients.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
During the interview and our discussion about Pernicious Anemia, one thing dr. Aldaher always came back to was that it’s currently pretty difficult to detect this disease, which in turn could mean that there are many people who have pernicious anemia without actually knowing it. The main reason for that is that diagnostic tools we are using today are very expensive and therefore most doctors are avoiding using them if it’s not really necessary. 
        </p>

        <p class="reveal">
To integrate his feedback into our project we decided to spend some time on working with possibilities to develop a more cost-effective diagnostic tool. We also learned from the interview that our solution also can be a template for improving treatment for other autoimmune diseases as well.</p>

      <section id="tag7">
        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Dr. Qian & Dr. Hou</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
          In order to understand the current incidence, risks, diagnosis and treatment of pernicious anemia, we have interviewed Dr. Qian from the Department of Hematology, Nantong University Affiliated Hospital and Dr. Hou, from the Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
From their point of view, Pernicious Anemia is a rare disease. However, we again got to hear that there may also be missed diagnosis, because the diagnosis process of pernicious anemia is complicated, and the symptoms are easily confused with other diseases. The current treatment of pernicious anemia is mainly intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 and according to them, development of oral vitamin B12 drug would be meaningful for clinical treatment of pernicious anemia.</p>

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Almedalen</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
          On July 4th our human practices team went all the way to Gotland to attend Almedalen. Almedalen is a democratic meeting place and a political event in Sweden organized by the parliamentary political parties. The aim of attending this event was to investigate how much Swedish politicians know about GMO, synthetic biology and its possibilities.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
We interviewed all eight main political parties from Sweden, where questions regarding healthcare, synthetic biology, GMOs and regulations regarding GMOs were asked. At the end of the day, we came to know that the majority of politicians we talked to don’t even know what a GMO actually is, and synthetic biology was for them a big mystery. Therefore we decided to continue with this work even after Almedalen by sending surveys and emails to all eight parties in order to get more useful information and insights from their side. We also wanted to raise awareness about synthetic biology among politicians and explain how it can be used to make a more sustainable society and therefore in continued work within education politicians became one of our main target groups in outreach. Reaching out to them was a bit difficult but we sent informative emails and messages to different politicians. We also asked some that have experience in being in parliament for an interview to establish a dialogue and discussion, but unfortunately the interview couldn’t take place.</p>

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">EMA</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
To discuss regulations regarding our project and product, we contacted the European Medicines Agency which is an agency within the EU. We got the opportunity to talk with Lorenzo Montrazio, who has been representing Italy in EMA.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
After explaining our project to him, Lorenzo explained that, in order to move from our research phase and perform toxicological and clinical trials, we would need 5 000 patients and 10 000 euros/patient. Since this requires a lot of money, usually the drug is first sold to a company that has all the resources. Lorenzo also explained that it takes 210 days for a concerned ministry to decide whether the product can enter the market and how the product will be used. This is because it requires different expertise, e.g. animal testing, testing and manufacturing.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
We also got to know that we can ask EMA for advice and help regarding if we should continue into a certain decision. This is similar to peer-review, experts with national authorities discuss our product with EMA and later on also with their national agency. All countries would provide us with questions and answers would be in relation to the development of the product. But for now, according to him, it is too early for us to consider regulations at this phase.

        <p class="reveal">
          To get feedback regarding our product development and business plan we contacted KI Innovation and KI Development.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
KI Innovations runs Karolinska Institutet's innovation office and an incubator. It is committed to transforming inventions and innovations from research into services and products, creating value for patients and society. With KI Innovation we had an in-depth communication with Patrik, who is the business coach of KI Innovation. With his help, we sorted out the project ideas and completed the draft of the business plan, including team introduction, core technology, products and markets extended by technology, and financial plan.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
With the help of KI Innovation we came in contact with Karolinska Development AB, which is an investment company focused on identifying medical innovations and investing in those. We had a meeting with Linda, who is the investment manager of Karolinska Development. We presented our business plan in detail and she gave us a lot of suggestions on how to improve it. Firstly, as a company, we can not have so many co-founders. We should establish the department and select important sub-team leaders as the co-founders. Others can hold the share with a holding platform. Secondly, we should consider the patent and that should be discussed with the specific consultant companies. Thirdly, as we are in the very early stage, we can apply for the funding granted by school, government or some foundations. When we have our drugs in preclinical stage, it would be Karolinska Development’s investment target.</p>
