    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams' efforts to actively consider how the world affects their work and their work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design, and execution.</p>
    <p>Please note you can compete for the Silver Medal criterion #3, Gold Medal criterion #1 and the Best Integrated Human Practices prize with this page.</p>
    <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://responsibility.igem.org/human-practices/what-is-human-practices">Human Practices Hub</a>.
    <p>On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.</p>

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Panel discution</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
In the very beginning of our iGEM journey, we arranged brainstorming sessions to discuss both global and local problems that are affecting society. During our brainstorming phase, we also organized a panel discussion with researchers from different fields to discuss our four project ideas. Different team members got to present the projects in front of the experts and after every presentation, the experts got time to ask questions and give us feedback.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
It was important for us to have different experts in the panel so we can get help with different parts of our project. Therefore we contacted both researchers from academia and industry but also experts within product development. The panel included experts from KTH, SciLifeLab, AstraZeneca, KI Innovation and Merck Innovation hub.

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Interview with Dr. Haitham Aldaher</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
During our iGEM year, we got the opportunity to talk with many researchers and doctors about our project and solution. One of the doctors we got the opportunity to interview was Dr. Haitham Aldaher, working in a child-care center in Stockholm. He is a specialist in pediatric neurology and has been working with children for decades. Even though we are focusing on pernicious anemia, a disease that is not so common among children and young people which also was confirmed by him, we still wanted to hear more about his experience.</p> 

        <p class="reveal">
When we asked about his opinion regarding our solution, he was very positive to it. Our idea with developing a pill would replace intramuscular injections, which would make life a bit easier for the patients.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
During the interview and our discussion about Pernicious Anemia, one thing dr. Aldaher always came back to was that it’s currently pretty difficult to detect this disease, which in turn could mean that there are many people who have pernicious anemia without actually knowing it. The main reason for that is that diagnostic tools we are using today are very expensive and therefore most doctors are avoiding using them if it’s not really necessary. 
        </p>

      <section id="tag7">
        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Interview with Dr. Qian and Dr. Hou</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
          In order to understand the current incidence, risks, diagnosis and treatment of pernicious anemia, we have interviewed Dr. Qian from the Department of Hematology, Nantong University Affiliated Hospital and Dr. Hou, from the Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
From their point of view, Pernicious Anemia is a rare disease. However, there may also be missed diagnosis, because the diagnosis process of pernicious anemia is complicated, and the symptoms are easily confused with other diseases. The treatment of pernicious anemia with positive intrinsic factor antibody is currently mainly intramuscular injection of vb12. Therefore, if we can successfully develop oral vb12 drugs, it will be meaningful for clinical treatment of pernicious anemia

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Almedalen</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
          On July 4th our human practices team went all the way to Gotland to attend Almedalen. Almedalen is a democratic meeting place and a political event in Sweden organized by the parliamentary political parties. The aim of attending this event was to investigate how much Swedish politicians know about GMO, synthetic biology and its possibilities.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
We interviewed all eight main political parties from Sweden, where questions regarding healthcare, synthetic biology, GMOs and regulations regarding GMOs were asked. At the end of the day, we came to know that the majority of politicians we talked to don’t even know what a GMO actually is, and synthetic biology was for them a big mystery. Therefore we decided to continue with this work even after Almedalen by sending surveys and emails to all eight parties in order to get more useful information and insights from their side. We also want to try to raise awareness about synthetic biology among politicians and explain how it can be used to make a more sustainable society. To do this we are making something that will be distributed.
