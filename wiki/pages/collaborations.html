        <p class="reveal">
        The teams from Lund (Sweden) and Paris (France) developed an amazing idea: the SynBio Dictionary. This dictionary helps those without any scientific background to understand the world of synthetic biology as much as the ones of iGEM. The iGEM teams from Uppsala, Chalmers and us - Stockholm - provided terms which are generally used in genetic engineering and biology. Then, the iGEM teams from Lund and Paris have formatted and designed the dictionary. After the “translation” section, the reader can apply their new knowledge and receive a first look into biological projects with short descriptions of each iGEM team’s project. This way, we aim to raise attention to the problems we want to tackle and raise curiosity for science, especially synthetic biology.</p>

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Level Up</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
        Together with iGEM ULaval, iGEM Patras and iGEM Thessaloniki, we were a part of the Level Up collaboration - a science communication collaboration in synthetic biology. Our goal was to raise awareness about synthetic biology and to explain to different audiences how it can be used to create a more sustainable society. By creating four pamphlets that explain the concept of synthetic biology at four different levels of complexity we were able to target four groups of people: children, high school students, general public and STEM students. 
To distribute all the pamphlets, our teams organized an event called iGEM Day at our universities. Apart from this, in order to reach out to more people and include different nationalities, we also asked other iGEM teams to participate by translating the pamphlets in their own language and distribute them at their universities.

            iGEM Stockholm and Chalmers-Gothenburg have collaborated with Riedia, a news media based application that was homegrown in KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The goal of this collaboration is to raise awareness among the people about our work, our teams and iGEM competition as a whole. Since the target audience of Riedia is students and internationals, it would help promote the field of synthetic biology as a potential area of research among young students and help the teams attract determined talents in the future. Since Riedia has recently started up its operations in Stockholm and Gothenburg, the teams have agreed upon bringing the application to the knowledge of the university students. This collaboration is being worked upon and will take effect sometime in October or November.
