        <h3 class="revealfromtop">Common interests</h3>
        <p class="reveal">After our post on the Global slack channel about our project topic and asking for potential collaborations, UZurich reached out to us! As they were working on the gut and inflammatory bowel disease, which is known to interplay with pernicious anaemia, we were more than happy to discuss our projects and see where we could go together!

        <p class="reveal">We laid down common goals for the competition: project development, education and regulations. In the lab, the Zurich team was working on a probiotic approach using nanobodies, which is different from our more in vitro approach of mutating a protein to evade autoimmunity. Where we could find common ground was the gut: we both saw that it is a hot area of research at the moment, but also that some diseases lacked effective treatment. Therefore, we set out to increase awareness of the gut’s various actors and the interplay between the gut microbiome and vitamins - our teams’ respective project topics. In addition, our business plans had similar concerns about regulations and clinical trials further down the line, and we had difficulties finding relevant information. Thus, we joined forces to each contact our national drug agencies and figure out how the process works in each country in order to get our medical products approved. We would then compare our results in order to list the differences and hopefully guide future iGEM teams in their choice of market authorisation approach. In addition, we sought to contact the FDA in order to have a more comprehensive comparison.</p>

      <section id="tag1_3">
        <h3 class="revealfromtop">The gut microbiome and vitamins - from food to disease to cure</h3>
        <p class="reveal">Our projects’ outreach efforts have been complementary to say the least. While we were researching vitamins, we saw that the gut microbiome came up constantly, and we also saw links with Pernicious Anaemia and gut diseases such as IBD. This is why we found it handy to combine and sum our efforts into one resource with more comprehensive information about the gut than any of us could produce on their own.
