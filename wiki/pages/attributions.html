    <h2>Why is this page needed?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. You can get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.</p>
    <p>For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6">
    <h2>Can we base our project on a previous one?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, <b>as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.</b></p>

              <p>Amela has carried our human practices to success: she has written a children’s book, prepared classroom activities and interviewed many experts throughout the project. She has also been adopted into the wetlab crew during the summer and she became a workhorse creating mutants and midi-prepping during her free time. With her young age, we don’t expect anything else from her other than becoming a great iGEM leader in the future.</p>

              <p>Daniela was our event manager for SiC, the wetlab taskmaster and a media person. She took up the monumental responsibility of the mutant production part in our project in its entirety and pulled it off. She co-ordinated the “big team” to produce the mutants at breakneck speeds and her long portfolio of other iGEM obligations. For the media team, she contributed with texts, postings and especially with directing the promotion video production alongside Adam and Sumant. Together with Pragha and Sumant, she came up with the idea of organising the first Swedish iGEM conference - short “SIC” - and created the fundament on which subsequent iGEM teams can build up a new tradition.</p>

              <p>Keerthi is another cornerstone of wetlab, who was indispensable with her experience in cell culture part of wet lab. Apart from leading the team for setting up the Transfection, Western Blotting, Flow cytometry and Flourecence Microscopy experiments, she solely led the cell culture faction for the entirety of its execution. She managed to reiterate the protocols until she and the instructors were satisfied. With parallel tasking master thesis and iGEM, she really made bought the vision of the project (Antibodies binding and B12 binding) successful in all her attempts.</p>

              <p>Pragha has been the solid link between the Wetlab and Finance team, but focusing a lot on both. Having a firm hand on the ever-increasing expenditures of the wet lab team, he was pivotal in navigating the corporate trenches getting us better deals at every turn. Thanks to him we have obtained grants and sponsors and he has made a substantial amount of mutants and cultures as well. You can often find him typing emails to prospective companies, drafting proposals and as well as organising fikas.</p>

              <p>Primarily a finance team member who has been the point of contact with banks in order to sort out internal fund transfers. Apart from that, she is involved in budgeting, finding external collaborations and sponsors, as well as pitching the product to different incubators. Thanks to her we have secured a sponsorship from a data analytics company so that we could use the tool to analyze data collected from the lab experiments. In addition to that, she has assisted the team with various grant applications, which served as a primary source of funding for the project. Additionally, being a part of both human practice and media teams, she acted as a moderator for our SIC conference, did market research and analysis to investigate the market potential for our product, and assisted in shooting a promotional video.</p>

              <p>A primary media guy, Sumant managed all of our social media channels and contributed to their content with stunning views from his drone! By listening to so many native speakers in different languages while recording and editing the 11 voice overs of our video, he must be a language expert by now. His ability of fast-understanding made him an amazing mate in the lab. His acumen and sincerity shines through even in wet lab experiments where he was responsible for getting us that perfect cloning result. He was the guy everyone called when the autoclave gave us problems. He also got dragged into almedalen and to perform interviews which earned him a role as honorary member of human practices. </p>
