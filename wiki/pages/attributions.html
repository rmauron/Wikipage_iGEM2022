    <h2>Why is this page needed?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. You can get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.</p>
    <p>For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6">
    <h2>Can we base our project on a previous one?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, <b>as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.</b></p>
