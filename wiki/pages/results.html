          The results from our experiments are shown on the following page. They are divided into Bacterial culture results and Mammalian cell culture results. The Bacterial part contains our PCR, cloning, sequencing and protein production results. The Mammalian part contains our results from mammalian cell culture and contains western blot, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry results. Some abbreviations that you will meet in the text are: wtIF(wild type intrinsic factor), pDisplay mammalian expression vector( the plasmid we bought from ThermoFisher).

          We purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific our mammalian expression vector <a href="#references">[1]</a>. pDisplay helps the proteins to be expressed in the surface of mammalian cells. With that way, the interactors of those proteins can be identified with different assays. Some of the features of pDisplay are T7 promoter,SV40 ori, Signal peptide for transmembrane transport, HA tag, Multiple cloning site, Myc tag, PDGFR transmembrane domain, Ampicilin and Neomycin resistance. We amplified the vector in E.coli TOP10 bacteria and performed gel electrophoresis to ensure that we isolate our plasmid. We realised that apart from our vector represented as “Band of interest” detected around 5kb there was Genomic DNA Contamination since another band appeared running higher at 10kb. We proceed with gel extracting only our band of interest in order to clone our gene into the plasmid.

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
          We purchased from IDT our wtIF gene with our extra modifications. We included a His-tag for protein production and purification of our protein in bacteria. Therefore, the primers we used to amplify the wtIF gene removed the His-tag and an intrinsic signal peptide that IF had. As it is pictured in the figure above after PCR amplification the size of wtIF gene is around 1.4kb meaning that we amplified our gene.  Our next step then is to perform restriction digestion with BglII and SalI-HF both in the wtIF gene but also in the pDisplay mammalian expression vector.  After this step the two parts were ligated together.

          These are the mutants that were carried forward for testing our binding assay. We tested the validity of those mutants by sending them for sequencing. In the picture above are shown the primers that we used to create them as well as the sequencing results highlighting the substitutions. The result shows that the necessary substitutions have taken their positions in the mutant variant.
