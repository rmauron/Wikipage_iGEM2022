          We purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific our mammalian expression vector (1). pDisplay helps the proteins to be expressed in the surface of mammalian cells. With that way, the interactors of those proteins can be identified with different assays. Some of the features of pDisplay are T7 promoter,SV40 ori, Signal peptide for transmembrane transport, HA tag, Multiple cloning site, Myc tag, PDGFR transmembrane domain, Ampicilin and Neomycin resistance. We amplified the vector in E.coli TOP10 bacteria and performed gel electrophoresis to ensure that we isolate our plasmid. We realised that apart from our vector represented as “Band of interest” detected around 5kb there was Genomic DNA Contamination since another band appeared running higher at 10kb. We proceed with gel extracting only our band of interest.

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">PCR amplification of wtIF gblock fragment</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p class="reveal">
          We purchased from IDT our wtIF gene with our extra modifications. We included a His-tag for protein production and purification of our protein in bacteria. Therefore, the primers we used to amplify the wtIF gene removed the His-tag and an intrinsic signal peptide that IF had. As it is pictured in the figure above after PCR amplification the size of wtIF gene is around 1.4kb.

        <p class="reveal">
          This is the colony PCR agarose gel electrophoresis image of the colonies screened for the wtIF fragment. The plasmids were extracted and amplified using the primers used to amplify the wtIF gene. The lone band in the H10 lane reflects the IF fragment in the solitary clone.
