    <h2>Patents and intellectual property</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.</p>
    <p>This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision.</p>

      <p class="reveal">Turning our project into a successful biotech company is not straightforward, so we have broken down the process into smaller steps.

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Phase 1: Research</h2>
            <p class="reveal">How we came up with our solution and how we shaped it to suit the market.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="tag1_1">
        <h3 class="revealfromtop">Project development</h3>
            <p class="reveal">Let us go back to the very start of our project where we were assessing the problem and the approach that we would use. In short, we aimed to tackle the autoimmune type of Pernicious Anaemia.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="tag1_1_1">
        <h4 class="revealfromtop">Brainstorming</h4>
            <p class="reveal">Coming up with a project idea requires the consideration of the whole context, which includes a business plan and preparing a market approach in order to sell our product. One of the first ideas we had was the proposal to market our mutated recombinant IF as a drug. In this drug, our IF will be in complex with vitamin B12 and the delivery method is a pill that is taken orally. The IF itself has been characterised as a potential drug carrier (1), therefore increasing the chances that our delivery method is feasible.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="tag1_1_2">
        <h4 class="revealfromtop">Market analysis</h4>
            <p class="reveal">In large surveys in the United States and the United Kingdom, approximately 6% of the population aged 60 years or older are Vitamin B12 deficient. The rate is much higher in underdeveloped and developing countries in Africa, and some parts of South-East Asia (2). Increasing prevalence of malnutrition among children across the globe is expected to result in the growth of the market for treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency.</p>

            <p class="reveal">The Global Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% from USD 292.6 million in 2019 to USD 409.7 million in 2027 (3). The demand is driven by the crucial functions of B12 in maintaining functions of many enzymes and the central nervous system (4). Another more critical reason is the prevention of megaloblastic anaemia (4).  On the other hand since we are considering selling our product as a drug, we investigated the market for protein drugs. </p>

            <p class="reveal">The market size of protein drugs is projected to grow 8.25% through 2022 to 2029, reaching nearly US$ 461.86 Billion (5). New protein therapies have developed after the first synthetic protein drug, which was human insulin (6). This market analysis seems promising for the future of our drug.</p>

            <p class="reveal">We found one potential competitor, Xeragenx, a business that makes recombinant human IF from plants. They are mainly targeting the B12 deficiency in general by making diagnostic home tests for B12 deficiency but also propose to use IF coupled with B12 as a nutritional supplement and as a drug delivery method (7).</p>
      </section>  

      <section id="tag1_1_3">
        <h4 class="revealfromtop">Cost analysis</h4>
            <p class="reveal">Developing a drug is expensive, and estimating the cost of producing our protein in the future is difficult based on the information that we have gathered during our experiments. The main factor that influences our production cost is scale, which means that our proof of concept production phase is a lot more expensive than bigger scale production later on. Therefore, we looked at a big company producing recombinant intrinsic factor, Sinobiological. Their list price is $2000 per milligram (8), which should serve as an adequate estimate for our production cost. Of course, an alternative to in-house production is to partner with Sinobiological. For this reason, we reached out to them and they agreed to sponsor us by sending us discounted products, while also showing interest in potentially collaborating in the future. 
In addition to the production cost of recombinant intrinsic factor, we need the amount that would be required for one dose. However, the required dosage is unknown to us and would need to be estimated in further studies, since it depends on many factors. Posology is commonly studied during phase I clinical trials (9). 
In short, we cannot estimate the cost of our drug, since the appropriate dose is unknown. As a very rough initial estimate, if a dose requires approximately one milligram of recombinant mutated intrinsic factor, then a dose would cost in the hundreds to thousands of dollars.</p>

      <section id="tag1_1_4">
        <h4 class="revealfromtop">Stakeholders analysis</h4>
            <p class="reveal">In order to deliver our product to the market we also conducted a stakeholders analysis taking into account the interest and the power of the stakeholders that will affect our approach. Since a big part of the project requires grants and funding it is important to investigate in advance the potential.
This is not a comprehensive list but there are stakeholders who might play a smaller role in this stage of the project such as: patients who will be more important in the later stages of our project when our drug is finally in the market.</p>

      <section id="tag1_1_5">
        <h4 class="revealfromtop">Panel discussion</h4>
            <p class="reveal">We tried to get in touch with people from research who work in the same field in order to help us improve our marketing and business approach. We were interested in listening to the opinion of experts for the possibility of selling our mutant IF with B12 as a pill. This would guide us to think more about the pros and cons of our product and improve our idea. In order to implement our idea we also wanted to take a look at the fundings that we could receive to bring our idea into life.What we learned from the experts that came to our panel discussion was that we needed to clarify the market for our product and that we mainly needed to show proof of concept. Some of the experts that were present in the panel discussion were from KI innovation, AstraZeneca, Merck Innovation hub, KTH and SciLifeLab.</p>

      <section id="tag1_2_1">
        <h4 class="revealfromtop">KI innovation</h4>
          <p class="reveal">KI Innovations runs Karolinska Institutet's innovation office and an incubator.It is committed to transforming inventions and innovations from research into services and products, creating value for patients and society.
At the beginning of the project, we take the commercialization of the project into consideration. So, we contacted KI Innovation. We had an in-depth communication with Patrik, who is the business coach of KI Innovation. He has extensive exprience in transforming ideas into business.   With his help, we have sorted out the project ideas and completed the draft of the business plan, including team introduction, core technology, products and markets extended by technology, and financial plan.Also,  KI innovation helped us connect with KI development, an early-stage investment institution focused on drug research and development. As far as another issue that is important for early projects - patents, KI Innovation suggested that we ask kth innovation for help as they have good partners in parenting.Apart from that,  KI innovation also granted us 25000 SEK for project development.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="tag1_2_2">
        <h4 class="revealfromtop">Karolinska Development</h4>
          <p class="reveal">Karolinska Development AB is an investment company focused on identifying medical innovation and investing in the creation and growth of companies developing these assets into differentiated products that will make a difference to patients’ lives and provide an attractive return on investment. It has established a portfolio of 10 companies targeting opportunities in innovative treatment for life-threatening or serious debilitating diseases.
 We have a meeting with Linda, who is the investment manager of Karolinska Development. We presented our business plan in detail. Linda has given us a lot of suggestions. Firstly, as a company, we can not have so many co-founders. We should establish the department and select important sub-team leaders as the co-founders. Others can hold the share with a holding platform. Secondly, we should consider the patent. How can we apply for the patent of our technology? It should be discussed with the sepcific consultant companies. Thirdly, as we are in the very early stage, we can apply for the funding granted by school, government or some foundations. When we have our drugs in preclinical stage,  it would be Karolinska Development’s investment target.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="tag1_2_3">
        <h4 class="revealfromtop">KTH Innovation</h4>
          <p class="reveal"><i>We should mention in the part above about KI innovation that they told us to try KTH Innovations for expertise regarding patent and intellectual property expertise.</i> At this phase in the project, we had concerns about the regulations that would apply to our product, and what we would need to focus on in order to plan ahead for eventual clinical trials. To get feedback on this aspect, we turned to one of our other universities through KTH Innovation, which acts as the supporting body for new solutions coming from KTH students and researchers. KTH Innovation has expertise in patent and intellectual property law, and we obtained valuable guidance. Mainly, we were told to focus on the technical readiness of our solution, which would mean that we would worry about regulations and approval later on. However, another area that they believed would be valuable to invest more into was market research. How many customers would need our product? How big would the impact be?</p>

          <p class="reveal">While we agreed with the importance of making our project work in a technical sense, we were not satisfied with waiting for later to know how our project would be received by regulatory bodies. Aside from that, market research became another priority for us, which led us to get in touch with clinicians, who would get to say whether they could see a use for our product in the field.

      <section id="tag1_2_4">
        <h4 class="revealfromtop">Doctors</h4>
        <h5 class="revealfromtop">2 Chinese Doctors</h5>
          <p class="reveal">In order to understand the current incidence, risks, current diagnosis and treatment of pernicious anaemia, we have interviewed Dr. Qian  from the Department of Haematology, Nantong University Affiliated Hospital and Dr. Hou, from the Department of Haematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.
From their point of view, Pernicious Anaemia is a rare disease. However, there may also be missed diagnosis, because the diagnosis process of pernicious anaemia is complicated, and the symptoms are easily confused with other diseases.
The treatment of pernicious anaemia with positive intrinsic factor antibody is currently mainly intramuscular injection of vb12. Therefore, if we can successfully develop oral vb12 drugs, it will be meaningful for clinical treatment of pernicious anaemia.</p>

        <h5 class="revealfromtop">Physician at BUM</h5>
          <p class="reveal">While the vast majority of pernicious anaemia cases are found in the population aged above 60, we wanted to confirm this with the experience of a physician. We got the opportunity to talk to NAME HERE, a physician based in Stockholm with more than a decade of experience working with teenagers and children. He had never encountered patients with pernicious anaemia in his career, while B12 deficiency was a relatively common occurrence among his patient groups. Since this confirmed our research thus far, we asked about our solution and what we could do to make it better.</p>
          <p class="reveal">In his opinion, a cheap diagnostics tool would be the most valuable for any disease, not only PA. SNP, protein and antibody arrays are great diagnostics tools that can target multiple diseases at once, but their main drawback is cost. For that reason, they only get used if the doctor suspects that the patient has a serious enough condition to warrant the cost. After realising the need for a more cost-effective diagnostics tool, we invested some time to devise a concept for a test that could accompany our solution.</p>
          <p class="reveal">When it came to the treatment option, our idea of a pill was well received thanks to the ease of use, as long as its cost could be kept down in order to maximise its use when deemed appropriate, not only in the most dire cases.
