        <h2>Swedish iGEM Conference</h2>
        <p>
          We started what we call a sister event of the ongoing Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) which is an annual meetup of all the iGEM teams in the Nordic region to share ideas and have a rehearsal of the final presentation before the Giant Jamboree. We have 5 teams in Sweden, namely, Stockholm, Lund, Chalmers-Gothenburg, Uppsala, and Linköping. We thought that having workshops and a meetup before we all started our lab work would be a great initiative to set the mood for the whole summer for the Swedish teams. We think this will help the teams plan their projects better after early feedback from experts. We had Mr. Pontus Christoffersen, who is an expert in presentation strategies giving us valuable advice which we could use to increase the impact of our project presentations. We also met more experts from the field of biotechnology to help give feedback on our ideas. The 3-day conference also included a lot of mingling and adventure activities to increase the bond between the participating teams. We plan to keep this tradition alive with each Swedish team organizing this conference on a rolling basis.

        <h2>Biobrick development</h2>
        <p>
          In many ways the Gastric intrinsic factor biobricks submitted by the iGEM Stockholm 2022 team represents a spiritual successor to the work performed by the iGEM Istanbul ITU 2013 team, which also centered their project on the characterization of the  same protein. While our team used different restriction sites around the gene (XXXX and XXXX), as opposed to the BamHI and XhoI sites used by the Istanbul team. Our goals with the project of course went beyond the characterization of the protein, and thus our parts feature some notable differences/developments compared to the Istanbul team’s part. Firstly, our parts feature a different promoter, making the gene expression inducable. Second, and more relevant to our application, our gene does not feature a purification tag since we did not intend to purify the protein. Secondly, we cloned our gene into a mammalian surface display vector, allowing it to be transfected into HEK cells for further study. This surface display feature is not a part of the submitted biobricks themselves, but was integrated around them.  Thus, we used the Istanbul team’s work as a proof of concept, while making adaptations that served our purposes. Lastly, and most significantly, our parts also include the most favourable autoantibody dodging mutants which our tests could identify. These represent the main results of our project and a direct development on the gene submitted by the Istanbul team. [1] [2] [3]
