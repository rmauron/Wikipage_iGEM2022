        <h2>Swedish iGEM Conference</h2>
        <p>
          We started what we call a sister event of the ongoing Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) which is an annual meetup of all the iGEM teams in the Nordic region to share ideas and have a rehearsal of the final presentation before the Giant Jamboree. We have 5 teams in Sweden, namely, Stockholm, Lund, Chalmers-Gothenburg, Uppsala, and Linköping. We thought that having workshops and a meetup before we all started our lab work would be a great initiative to set the mood for the whole summer for the Swedish teams. We think this will help the teams plan their projects better after early feedback from experts. We had Mr. Pontus Christoffersen, who is an expert in presentation strategies giving us valuable advice which we could use to increase the impact of our project presentations. We also met more experts from the field of biotechnology to help give feedback on our ideas. The 3-day conference also included a lot of mingling and adventure activities to increase the bond between the participating teams. We plan to keep this tradition alive with each Swedish team organizing this conference on a rolling basis.

        <h2>Biobrick development</h2>
        <p>
          In many ways the Gastric intrinsic factor biobricks submitted by the iGEM Stockholm 2022 team represents a spiritual successor to the work performed by the iGEM Istanbul ITU 2013 team, which also centered their project on the characterization of the  same protein. It should be noted, however, that we used different restriction sites around the bricks compared to the Istanbul. Our goals with the project of course went beyond the characterization of the protein (the extent of the 2013 project), and thus our parts feature some notable differences/developments compared to the Istanbul team’s part. Firstly, our parts feature a LacI promoter, allowing inducibility and increasing expression. Second, and more relevant to our application, our parts feature his6 purification tags instead of the GST purification tag used by the 2013 team. This choice was made because a small tag (840.8 Da) was desirable over a larger one like GST (26 kDa) in order to minimize the risk of the tag impacting the folding of the GIF (and thus, the for our project crucial epitope structure and vitamin B12 affinity). We cloned our gene into a mammalian surface display vector, allowing it to be transfected into HEK cells for further study. This surface display feature is not a part of the submitted biobricks themselves, but was integrated around them.  Lastly, one of our parts (BBa_K4214000), features a periplasmic secretion sequence (pelB), yielding simplified purification of the protein during initial tests in our project. Together, these modifications should allow for simplified production and purification of an GIF protein closer to the wild type, compared to the predecessor from Istanbul.  <a href="#references">[1]</a><a href="#references">[2]</a><a href="#references">[3]</a>.

        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>
          In order to perform the mutagenesis of IF in a systematic manner, our drylab subteam created a software that allows you to input a sequence of DNA and simulate amino acid substitutions on that sequence. The software takes various user input to optimise the mutagenesis to their specifications, such as whether to disrupt or preserve the protein structure according to a substitution matrix, how many substitutions the software should induce, and where in the sequence they’re wanted.

The software also has a function to predict how the protein will be affected by a mutation, including a scoring function so it can evaluate whether the mutation will be beneficial to the protein.

More in-depth information about how the software functions and about its inner workings can be found in the software documentation:
