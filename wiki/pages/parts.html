    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will add them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts</p>
    <p>Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.</p>

      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>Parts must be well documented on each Part's Main Page on the <a href="http://parts.igem.org">Registry</a>. This documentation includes all of the characterization data for your parts. <b>The part's data MUST be on the part's Main Page on the Registry for your team to be eligible for medals and special prizes pertaining to parts.</b></p>
      <p>This page serves to <i>showcase</i> the parts you have made and should include links to the Registry pages for your parts. Future teams and other users are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.</p>

    <h2>Adding parts to the Registry</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>You can add parts to the Registry at our <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Add_a_Part_to_the_Registry">Add a Part to the Registry</a> page.</p>
    <p>We encourage teams to start adding and documenting their parts on the Registry as soon as they can. Once you add your parts to the Registry, you can continue to add documentation to them throughout the iGEM season (up until the Registry freeze). This will allow you to remember all the details about your parts and store their history in the wiki. Documentation includes the characterization data of your parts.</p>

    <h2>What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Part Name</li>
      <li>Part type</li>
      <li>Creator</li>
      <li>Sequence</li>
      <li>Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)</li>
      <li>Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)</li>
      <li>Design considerations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We encourage you to put up <em>much more</em> information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, you must also put it up on the part page.</p>
