            <p class="reveal">
              One of our main goals within education has been to make our school visits as interactive and as fun as possible. We decided to do this by letting children do what they like the most - play games. To make it easier for both teachers and us to explain basic principles of synthetic biology in an interesting and simple way, we created a LEGO game where students are supposed to modify organisms by making their own plasmids with the help of lego bricks.

        <p class="reveal">
          Vitamins are highly important to keep the body working properly. Our aim is to raise awareness about vitamins among children and to make them understand why vitamins are so important. One of the easiest ways to reach out to children is by illustrating and telling them a story. That is why we have written a children’s book, named “Stories from Albert’s market”. In this book, the function that all vitamins have in our body and their sources are described in a simple and interesting way to make sure that even the youngest one can understand it. The book was translated to Swedish and English and they were distributed around childcare centers, hospitals and school libraries in Stockholm.

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Level Up Collab</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
          Together with iGEM ULaval, iGEM Patras and iGEM Thessaloniki, we were a part of the Level Up collaboration - a science communication collaboration in synthetic biology. Main goal with this collaboration was to communicate synthetic biology and explain to different audiences how it can be used to create a more sustainable society. By creating four pamphlets that explain the concept of synthetic biology at four different levels of complexity we were able to target four groups of people. For more information visit the Collaboration page.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
To target general public and STEM students, we organized an iGEM day at three different university campuses in Stockholm on September 13th, where we distributed 600 pamphlets. During the distribution we also had the opportunity to have a dialogue with students about synthetic biology and its possibilities, but also talk about Pernicious Anemia and our project BIG-IF.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
Pamphlets for children were distributed during our elementary school visits. During European researchers night (ForskarFredag), we distributed pamphlets for the general public and teenagers. this part will be modified after the events when i know more about what happened, now i'm just guessing</p>

        <p class="reveal">
A total of … pamphlets were distributed around Stockholm. 
you will get a number after all school visits, and also some pictures

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Rays visit</h2>

        <p class="reveal">
          In late June, our human practices team organized a workshop about synthetic biology for high-school students in a summer science school named Rays. The workshop started with us introducing iGEM and synthetic biology by talking about common techniques we are using every day in our lab. But since we believe that the best way of learning synthetic biology is by practicing, we let the students do something hands-on.</p> 

        <p class="reveal">
First thing we did was to show them how to use a micropipette. We had a pipette-school where all students had to pipette 1000µL of water into a beaker and try to get as close as possible to 1g when weighed.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
After the pipette-school it was time to start with the main assignment. To let them get a taste of how it is to work with synthetic biology, they got the opportunity to practice PCR. All students got different BioBrick samples with different lengths to do a PCR on. The PCR samples were loaded on a gel by us and the day after students got assignment to interpret the results.</p> 

        <p class="reveal">
Comments from students who attended the workshop:
<i>“It was fun to prepare samples for PCR, which you have read about in school but never got the opportunity to do. The workshop made the process more concrete!”</i></p>

        <p class="reveal"><i>
“I have gained an increased understanding of how it can be applied and combined with other kinds of science.”</i>
