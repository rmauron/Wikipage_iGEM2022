        <p class="reveal">The most important part for successful development of the society is education. By developing educational tools, writing a childrens’ book, visiting schools, and having meaningful discussions with the public and politicians, our team managed to target five groups of people with our outreach.</p>

            <p class="reveal">One of our main goals within education has been to make our school visits as interactive and as fun as possible. We decided to do this by letting children do what they like the most - play games. To make it easier for both teachers and us to explain basic principles of synthetic biology in an interesting and simple way, we created a LEGO game where students are supposed to modify organisms by making their own plasmids with the help of lego bricks.</p>
            <p class="reveal">After using LEGO during our workshop we asked students to anonymously give us feedback and to tell us whether the game made it easier to understand the concept of plasmids and how to design them. 28 students answered our poll and 25 students answered that LEGO game made it easier to understand and made the whole workshop much more interactive. </p>

        <p class="reveal">
          Vitamins are highly important to keep the body working properly. Our aim is to raise awareness about vitamins among children and to make them understand why vitamins are so important. One of the easiest ways to reach out to children is by illustrating and telling them a story. That is why we have written a children’s book, named “Stories from Albert’s market”. In this book, the function that all vitamins have in our body and their sources are described in a simple and interesting way to make sure that even the youngest one can understand it. The book was translated to Swedish and English and they were distributed around childcare centers, hospitals and school libraries in Stockholm.

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Level Up Collab</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
          Together with iGEM ULaval, iGEM Patras and iGEM Thessaloniki, we were a part of the Level Up collaboration - a science communication collaboration in synthetic biology. Main goal with this collaboration was to communicate synthetic biology and explain to different audiences how it can be used to create a more sustainable society. By creating four pamphlets that explain the concept of synthetic biology at four different levels of complexity we were able to target four groups of people. For more information visit the Collaboration page.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
To target general public and STEM students, we organized an iGEM day at three different university campuses in Stockholm on September 13th, where we distributed 600 pamphlets. During the distribution we also had the opportunity to have a dialogue with students about synthetic biology and its possibilities, but also talk about Pernicious Anemia and our project BIG-IF.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
To target children, high-school students, but also the general public once again we distributed pamphlets during European researchers night (ForskarFredag). We also distributed pamphlets during our high-school visit and in total, around 700 pamphlets were distributed in Stockholm. </p>

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">Rays visit</h2>

        <p class="reveal">
          In late June, our human practices team organized a workshop about synthetic biology for high-school students in a summer science school named Rays. The workshop started with us introducing iGEM and synthetic biology by talking about common techniques we are using every day in our lab. But since we believe that the best way of learning synthetic biology is by practicing, we let the students do something hands-on.</p> 

        <p class="reveal">
First thing we did was to show them how to use a micropipette. We had a pipette-school where all students had to pipette 1000µL of water into a beaker and try to get as close as possible to 1g when weighed.</p>

        <p class="reveal">
After the pipette-school it was time to start with the main assignment. To let them get a taste of how it is to work with synthetic biology, they got the opportunity to practice PCR. All students got different BioBrick samples with different lengths to do a PCR on. The PCR samples were loaded on a gel by us and the day after students got assignment to interpret the results.</p>

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">High school</h2>
        <p class="reveal">We also visited 35 students studying their third year science program in Tullinge Gymnasium, a high school in Stockholm. After getting feedback from students participating in Rays, we changed our workshop style according to their opinions for the next school visit. According to the students, the workshop could be improved by going into more details when explaining different techniques. We decided to therefore have a longer presentation with first explaining basics of biotechnology and synthetic biology, followed by more detailed explanation by going through different steps in our project. During the presentation we also let students answer questions to make it more interactive.</p>

        <p class="reveal">This time, instead of having lab work with students, we decided to after the presentation let them play with the LEGO game we developed and that way they got to learn more about plasmids and how to design these.</p>

        <p class="reveal">At the end we asked them to fill out an anonymous survey where we asked whether or not the workshop was informative and if the LEGO game made it easier to understand the concept of plasmids.</p>

        <h2 class="revealfromtop">ForskarFredag</h2>
        <p class="reveal">
          Since our school visits were aimed at teenagers already studying science, in order to also meet students from other fields we decided to be part of the exhibition at ForskarFredag. ForskarFredag is part of European Researchers’ Night, a large festival taking place all over Europe which aims to bring science and researchers closer to the public, and especially children. 
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
          During ForskarFredag we got the opportunity to talk with a lot of different students, but also teachers and other researchers, about synthetic biology and our project. We were explaining how microorganisms and gene technology can be used to solve problems society is facing, through, among other things, our project and technologies we used. Unfortunately we got a more meaningful dialogue and interaction with adults than students and we also realized that there is hardly any interest for synthetic biology among students we met, mostly because their knowledge is weak, based on dry school theory. Therefore we would like to, in the future, contact the Swedish National Agency for Education and discuss the possibilities of making education in STEM subjects more interactive, and thus also hopefully increase the interest for STEM among students.
